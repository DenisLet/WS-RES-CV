Good day,
I am highly interested in the QA Engineer position at your company. My professional experience began in the maritime industry, where I served as a Navigation Officer. In this role, I was responsible for vessel management, route planning, and communication with other ships and coastal services through VHF, MF/HF radio, and satellite communication. Additionally, my duties included regular testing and maintenance of navigation equipment such as radars, ECDIS, compasses, GPS, etc., as well as communication equipment like VHF, MF/HF radios, AIS, Inmarsat, VSAT, Navtex, and more.
My experience as a vessel traffic service operator in the Port of St. Petersburg provided me with a deep understanding of the intricacies of navigation both in open waters and port’s areas. My responsibilities included route coordination, ensuring safe and efficient vessel movement, and interaction with crews using various communication means. This experience strengthened my skills in vessel traffic organization, considering all factors influencing navigation.
My experience also encompasses working with Wärtsilä navigation solutions, including electronic charting and e-navigation, which underscored the importance of accuracy and reliability in navigation systems.
I have independently studied software testing theory and automation using Python, which has been my passion for a considerable time. I am familiar with libraries such as Pytest, Selenium, Playwright, Requests, Faker, Pydantic and many others, and I can write automated tests for both user interfaces and APIs. I also have experience working with Jira and a understanding of Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall methodologies. I have significant experience with both Linux and Windows operating systems and possess basic knowledge of TCP/IP and OSI models. Furthermore, I am acquainted with essential Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions functionalities.
I am eager to develop my skills in the field of information technology in the maritime industry.
I believe that my experience and skills could be a valuable asset to your team. I am available to provide more detailed information and to meet for an interview.
Sincerely, 
Denis Letunovskii
